<h4 class="shadow-text">This is my first assignment for week 1 of the front end development course from Promineo Tech. Coming from a place of very little experience with even using a laptop i'm happy to say Things seem to slowly be starting to make sense. For this assignment I chose 3 random things I'm very passionate about being martial arts with Muay Thai being the one I'm currently training. Followed by nature and animal conservation or really even just learning about it ever since i was a kid I've always been fascinated by the world around me and the things that live on it. Finally, tabletop rpgs becasue why not? I almost put video games but it turns out someone already chose that for their assignment. but who knows? maybe I'll be able to code a DnD Beyond app that will actually work! </h4>
